    <string name="chest_four_description"> Set both pulleys directly at (or slightly above) shoulder height and select the desired weight.
Grasp both handles with a neutral grip and take a step forward to split the stance.
Press the handles to lockout while flexing the pecs and extending the elbows.
Keep a slight bend in the elbows, move entirely at the shoulder joint, and slowly allow the arms to open while the pecs stretch.
Return to the starting position by flexing your pecs and bringing the handles together at chest height.
Slowly lower back to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</string>
    <string name="chest_two_description">Lie flat on a bench and set your hands just outside of shoulder width.
Set your shoulder blades by pinching them together and driving them into the bench.
Take a deep breath and allow your spotter to help you with the lift off in order to maintain tightness through your upper back.
Let the weight settle and ensure your upper back remains tight after lift off.
Inhale and allow the bar to descend slowly by unlocking the elbows.
Lower the bar in a straight line to the base of the sternum (breastbone) and touch the chest.
Push the bar back up in a straight line by pressing yourself into the bench, driving your feet into the floor for leg drive, and extending the elbows.
Repeat for the desired number of repetitions </string>
