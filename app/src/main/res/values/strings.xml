    <string name="chest_one_desription">The basic incline pushup is done using a bench, table, or another solid surface that is about 3 feet high.
        \n\nHere\'s how to do this style correctly:
\n\nStand facing the bench, table, or the edge of a bed.
\n\nPlace your hands on the edge of the bench just slightly wider than shoulder width. Your arms are straight but elbows are not locked. Align your feet so that your arms and body are completely straight.
\n\nBend your elbows to slowly lower your chest to the edge of the bench while inhaling. Keep your body straight and rigid throughout the movement.
\n\nPush your body away from the bench until your elbows are extended, but not locked. Exhale as you push up.
\n\nKeep going with slow, steady repetitions.</string>
