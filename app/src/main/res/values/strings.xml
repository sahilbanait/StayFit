    <string name="chest_three_description"> Lie back on an incline bench. Make sure the bench is adjusted to between 15 and 30 degrees on an incline.
        Anything higher than 30 degrees mainly works the anterior deltoids (shoulders). Your grip should be where your elbows make a 90-degree angle.
        \nUsing a shoulder-width grip, wrap your fingers around the bar with your palms facing away from you.
        Lift the bar up from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked.
        As you breathe in, come down slowly until the bar is an inch away from your chest.
        \nYou want the bar to be in line with your upper chest the whole time. Your arms should be at a 45-degree angle and tucked into your sides.
        Hold this position for one count at the bottom of this movement and, with one big exhale, push the bar back up to your starting position.
        Lock your arms, hold, and come down slowly.
        \nDo 12 repetitions and then place the bar back on the rack.
        Complete a total of five sets, adding weight after each set.</string>
    <string name="chest_four_description"> Set both pulleys directly at (or slightly above) shoulder height and select the desired weight.
        Grasp both handles with a neutral grip and take a step forward to split the stance.
        Press the handles to lockout while flexing the pecs and extending the elbows.
        Keep a slight bend in the elbows, move entirely at the shoulder joint, and slowly allow the arms to open while the pecs stretch.
        Return to the starting position by flexing your pecs and bringing the handles together at chest height.
        Slowly lower back to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</string>
    <string name="chest_two_description">
        Lie flat on a bench and set your hands just outside of shoulder width.
        Set your shoulder blades by pinching them together and driving them into the bench.
        \nTake a deep breath and allow your spotter to help you with the lift off in order to maintain tightness through your upper back.
        Let the weight settle and ensure your upper back remains tight after lift off.
        \nInhale and allow the bar to descend slowly by unlocking the elbows.
        Lower the bar in a straight line to the base of the sternum (breastbone) and touch the chest.
        \nPush the bar back up in a straight line by pressing yourself into the bench,
        driving your feet into the floor for leg drive,
        and extending the elbows.Repeat for the desired number of repetitions </string>
    <string name="chest_one_description">Stand in front of your box or bench, then squat or bend down and
        place both hands on either side of it with your fingers pointing forward.Your hands should be about shoulder-width apart.
        If you need a wider piece of equipment to safely elevate yourself, don’t be shy about swapping it out.\n
        Once your hands are in the right position, step your body back into a plank position, one leg at a time.
        Make sure your body is in a straight line, your head is aligned with your spine, and that your lower back isn’t sagging before continuing.
        Looking a few inches ahead of you, rather than down at the box, can help keep your body straight.
        \nNext, bend your arms to help you slowly lower your chest toward the box. Straighten your arms to bring yourself back up into a straight line.
        Repeat 10 times for 3 sets to start. You can increase the repetitions within each set as you get stronger.</string>
